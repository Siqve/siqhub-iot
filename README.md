# SiqHub - IoT â€“ Embedded Controller

## Description
Hobby project, creating an IoT embedded controller for home automation. 
The project is based on the ESP32 microcontroller and the Arduino framework. 
The controller is designed to be modular and expandable, 
with the ability to add new modules and sensors as needed. 

The controller listens for commands over Supabase, using their realtime API. 
The interface sending commands is the [SiqHub web app](https://github.com/Siqve/siqhub-web).
